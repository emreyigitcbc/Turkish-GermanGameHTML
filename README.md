# German-Turkish PHP Game

This is a "find the translation" game made with PHP and HTML.

## Usage
When you download it, you have to change one line in `Header.php`,
edit `$site = "YOUR_SITE_URL";` line.

Using is very simple, you can change page language, bottom of the page, It wont effect words' database. This game is only for "German to Turkish".
